# Hi, I'm Yash 👋👨‍⚖️

Future Engineer and lifelong humanitarian. I'm a second-year student at PSIT College of Engineering, Kanpur.

Being an engineering student I have been exposed to diverse groups of people. This has made me able to quickly adapt to changes and gain a broader perspective. I am always curious about things and enjoy learning. I like to solve problems and fix errors. I am a detail-oriented person and I keep my goals and tasks organized to maintain productivity.

I believe that the skills that I have attained from the dynamic environment and competitive college life define me and I am looking forward to implementing and polishing them in any opportunity that I receive.
